        My heart is a poet, <br>
        It beats in a rhythm <br>
        From that, a poem    <br>
        Would born.

    <p id="p1">
        I thought I have changed <br>
        I believed I have separated <br>
        A part of me to travel for <br>
        Peace, when all the left over <br>
        pieces of me wage a war <br>
        among themselves.

        She return with a rush <br>
        Showcasing her success <br>
        With a vivid smile. <br>
        I behold when she smiles, <br>
        She takes shape of love. <br>
    </p>

    <h3>  It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop. <br>
          Three things cannot be long hidden: the sun, the moon, and the truth. <br>
          Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and <br>
          I shall move the world.  </h3>
